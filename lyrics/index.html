				Here we are

				On the road together
				<br />
				Racing time

				You &amp; I

				<p class="script">
				Trying to climb
				<br />
				The snakes and ladders
				<br />
				Then block the shine
				<br />
				And blind your eyes

				<p class="script">
				'Cause it's easy to feel weighed down
				<br />
				And it's easy to blame ourselves
				<br />
				When the sky is filled up with clouds
				<br />
				Raining down, yeah

				<br />
				Oh it's you and me against the world
				<br />
				Oh it's you and me

				It's you and me

				It's you and me

				Against the world
