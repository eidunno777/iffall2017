				Here we are
				<br />
				On the road together
				<br />
				Racing time
				<br />
				You &amp; I
				<br />
				</p><br>

				<p class="script">
				Trying to climb
				<br />
				The snakes and ladders
				<br />
				Then block the shine
				<br />
				And blind your eyes
				</p><br>

				<p class="script">
				'Cause it's easy to feel weighed down
				<br />
				And it's easy to blame ourselves
				<br />
				When the sky is filled up with clouds
				<br />
				Raining down, yeah

				(chorus)	
				<br />
				'Cause it's you and me against the world now
				<br />
				And it's you and me against the world now
				<br />
				'Cause it's you and me against the world
				<br />
				Oh it's you and me against the world
				<br />
				Oh it's you and me
				<br />
				It's you and me
				<br />
				It's you and me
				<br />
				Against the world

				Oh it's you and me against the world

				<br />
				And it's you and me against the world

				Oh it's you and me against the world now
				</p><br>
		
				<p class="script">	
				Waiting now 
				<br />
				On the side of nowhere
				<br />
				Spinning tires
				<br />
				Worn and tired
				</p><br>

				<p class="script">	
				Reading maps
				<br />
				Lead us somewhere
				<br />
				We didn't plan
				<br />
				But here we stand
				</p><br>

				<p class="script">					
				And it's easy to feel weighed down
