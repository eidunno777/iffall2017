	<p> I recieved feedback from both Marina and Lucas. Both informed me that I should change my typeface and scale it up for at the current size it is hard to read. They also both agreed that the page would improve if there was more interaction (scrolling / buttons - return to top / popup info) as for currently the page is just a static image. They also weren't crazy about the color choices for the background and the text as they did not match my yellow/orange/pink/white title text image or the black bass drop image I am using. They did like my heirarchy of information with the title of the song being the largest thing followed by the artist's name (Bassnectar) and then lastly the text being the smallest thing (though they said it was too small). They also wanted me to add either a little bit of my design voice or that of the artist. Currently my design isn't hedious but isn't very remarkable and fails to communicate anything about the song / about me / or about the artist. I plan to change this on my next iteration but immitating the sleek and top notch production value that comes with every bassnectar show. Also through some added images of Nectar doing his thing I hope to show the audience what this man is like.
