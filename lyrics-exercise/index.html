		Here we are
		<br />
		On the road together
		<br />
		Racing time
		<br />
		You &amp; I
		<br />
		</p>

		<p class="script">
		Trying to climb
		<br />
		The snakes and ladders
		<br />
		Then block the shine
		<br />
		And blind your eyes
		</p>

		<p class="script">
		'Cause it's easy to feel weighed down
		<br />
		And it's easy to blame ourselves
		<br />
		When the sky is filled up with clouds
		<br />
		Raining down, yeah
		</p>

		<p class="script">		
		'Cause it's you and me against the world now
		<br />
		And it's you and me against the world now
		<br />
		'Cause it's you and me against the world
		<br />
		Oh it's you and me against the world
		<br />
		Oh it's you and me
		<br />
		It's you and me
		<br />
		It's you and me
		<br />
		Against the world
		</p>

		<p class="script">	
		Oh it's you and me against the world
		<br />
		And it's you and me against the world
		<br />
		Oh it's you and me against the world now
		<br />
		And it's you and me against the world
		<br />
		And it's you and me against the world
		<br />
		Oh it's you and me against the world now
		</p>

		<p class="script">	
		Waiting now 
		<br />
		On the side of nowhere
		<br />
		Spinning tires
		<br />
		Worn and tired
		</p>

		<p class="script">	
		Reading maps
		<br />
		Lead us somewhere
		<br />
		We didn't plan
		<br />
		But here we stand
		</p>

		<p class="script">					
		And it's easy to feel weighed down
		<br />
		And it's easy to blame ourselves

		When the sky is filled up with clouds
		<br />
		Raining down

		<p class="script">	
		'Cause it's you and me against the world now
