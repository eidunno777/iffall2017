<h1> FEEDBACK FOR RHEA </h1>
Aesthetic
<br>
	•	Is the design beautiful/striking/remarkable? Image 1: I like how your using the frame of the image to break the text down the middle but I wonder if you can take this further.<br>
	<br>
		Right now both the image and the text are at a similar smallish scale and I think playing up one or the other could make the image more interesting but you may just need to change your image choice. At the mobile scale I don’t think this is as much of a problem but at the web size the amount of negative space is too much. Also at the mobile scale I’m really liking how he seems to be standing on the quote.<br>
		<br>
		The other 2 image sets are very nice (im especially liking your composition of the web version of image 2 - that type placement and shape is A1)<br>
		<br>
		For that images mobile version I like how your putting the type b/w the buttons but you may want to lift up ‘Hedi Slimane <br>
		<br>
		<br>
	•	Does the design aesthetic relate to the concept? I like how theres 2 voices in the first quote which is somewhat echoed by the split down the quote. <br>
	<br>
	•	Do the imagery and design choices support the text? Yes jeans for jeans quote, seductive pose for seductive quote, heroism quote has heroism<br>
<br>
	•	Is the aesthetic consistent? Yes I like your consistent use of type placement at the mobile version 	<br>
		Even though I don’t know who the person is the mood I get from the imagery / type seems to give off his vibe (just checked his website and you definitely capture that vibe)
		<br>
	•	Is the aesthetic driving the concept, or vice-versa? Aestheticccc<br>
<br>
	•	Is it legible? At the mobile version I think the type might be a little too small.<br> 
<br>
	•	Are type size/color/face/treatment choices helping or hurting? I think your use of black and white is really helping the overall concept and mood created <br>
<br>
<br>
Structure<br>
	•	What are the design’s visual priorities? <br>
	•	Are design elements working in contrast, complement, or conflict? The duality of the black and white is echoed by the text which often plays a quiet role that lets the image do the work and complements it<br>
<br>
	•	What elements do you consider foreground? Background? For the mobile versions the type and image appear on the same plane, and for image 1 and 3 web versions the type seems to be in front while in image 2 the type seems on the same plane<br>
<br>
	•	How will the design accommodate variability in browser width?  At the moment it seems like you can only support 2 responsive jumps, have you started to consider what it would look like if you had more points?<br>
<br>
	•	Is transparency, if used, used appropriately? <br>
<br>
Technical Challenges<br>
	•	What happens at all of the sizes in between the desktop and mobile versions that have been provided? <br>
	•	At what point does text collide with imagery? At what point does contrast affect legibility? Important to consider especially with your black and white imagery/type, for some of the images (especially image 2) you will need to resize the image or rescale the type as your screen gets smaller<br>

<h1> FEEDBACK FOR KATIE </h1>
<h3>Aesthetic</h3>
<ul>
<l1>The bright colors and big and bold white type relate well with the playful theme that your images convey. </l1>
<l1>Also I like the consistency of leaving the animal at the same position of each comp. and letting the animal image fill up the whole frame </l1>
<l1>The dogs image needs a cleaner crop and possibly a higher res image but the rest of your images like great.</l1>


<h3>Structure</h3>
 <l1>I think carrying this same consistency of image position and text size throughout each different comp. as each scale down would be nice</l1>
<l1>Now that you’ve gone with this very consistent composition/type treatment throughout make sure that carries through in your responsiveness</l1>
 

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
 
<l1>Im not really sure what other feedback to give you here your compositions are pretty simple but I think that goes well with conveying your simple and playful theme
